Multiple completed university projects in software engineering, data science, embedded systems, & other advanced computer science.

> The following are examples from over __100__ `.git` projects, most completed well pre-GenAI (& rather all perfectly under the most least of ideal circumstances), some since integrating LLM, many involving extensive collaboration, & all averaging with distinction:

- Distributed real-time system for global semi-autonomous asynchronous robotic depot storage
- Wide-area wireless embedded networking system for low-power autonomous wildlife surveillance
- Configurable software design & cross-platform prototyping of multiple use-case match algorithm
- BDD/TDD vehicle registration app, requirements engineered seamless E-commerce art gallery web app, etc & QA
- Microcellular image analysis & ResNet & U-Net classifying diagnosis & treatment, & XAI
- Low-level parallelisation of graphically heat-mapped, collision-free pedestrian crowd simulation
- Distributed parallelisation of a malaria endemic stochastic simulation algorithm using Monte Carlo
- Bayesian probabilistic ML modelling of sport match data for predicting ranking using MS Trueskill
- Deep reinforcement learning for industrial job-shop scheduling - _antecedes & constitutes "original" namesake thesis_
- UX-driven real-time interactive multi-sensory empathetic humanoid (portraitist) AI-agent using LLM & CNN
- Interrupt-driven, real-time remote helicopter state, orientation & operation controller using PWM
- Simulating XYZ TCP/UDP socket communication, LP flow optimization & dynamic RIP networking
- Java monopoly & kalah, inter-MCU, React.js board, AI quarto, RL Snake & [Pong](https://youtube.com/shorts/AHTU2rjeZ1c), FP sudoku (25x25+) & ultimate-TTT, etc. games
- Parking, rego, supply chain, auction, bar, itinerary route planner, forum, etc. (G)UI apps of varying FW
- 3D-animated scenery & interactive gameplay with ray tracing, particle system & real-World physics
- Cross-platform application prototype for streamlining offshore-focused maritime mooring planning
- Maintainable distributed multi-sensor MCU-IMU API with IRQ-driven interface to AHRS & config support
- and much more to be listed soon, including multiple in GIS, not to mention other projects completed without using `.git`

<!-- ðŸ¤“ Fun facts: 
- I completed more than enough credits with distinction at advanced/masters level for one if not two degrees before I could possibly officially complete a basic/bachelors degree, regardless of at least enough credits for two more degrees, including formal exchanges.
  <!-- This is given the most adverse of cirumstances, which although independently 'overcome', involves multiple consecutive severe & other significantly inhibiting injuries, including paralyses, amnesia, motor-skill loss, sight & hand-eye coordination loss, extremely harmful & damaging - in all aspects - 24/7 wrongdoing plagues, & a lifetime of induced sleep deprivation. A study in itself. -->
<!-- - [GitStats](https://github.com/R055A/GitStats) was initially deployed before a uni project including CI/CD visualising GitHub API-fetched stats for the first instance of an advanced data engineering course. Not the first case of unwittingly preempting assessments ahead of courses, nor the last of irony. -->

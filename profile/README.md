Multiple completed university projects in software engineering, data science, embedded systems, & other advanced computer science.

> The following are examples from over __100__ `.git` projects, most completed well pre-GenAI (& rather all perfectly under the most least of ideal circumstances), some since integrating LLM, many involving extensive collaboration, & all averaging with distinction:

& more pins on the way... 

Believe it or not, but I barely code. Most descriptions written in retrospect on a spur. Will update soon with public Pages links!
